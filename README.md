# SBB Ticket Audit
This Projects provides all Frontend functionality for the SBB Ticket Audit App. The App allows you to summerize your spendings on online SBB purchasing. 

## What it does
You receive a confirmation E-Mail for every bought online SBB Ticket. This App gathers all the Data together and provides a readable summary of all your purchases. Therefore, the [Server Application](https://github.com/gnochi/sbb-ticket-audit-api) needs to have access on your Mail Accout (by now, only Google Mail Accounts are considered). At the end of the day, the App should answer the question if you should buy a Generalabonnement or not. 

## Pre Requirements
Install Node `https://nodejs.org/en` and all in this Project required Dependencies `npm install`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
